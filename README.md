**Create a custom Bracket City puzzle!**

This project contains a simple, interactive HTML tool that lets you create your own custom version of The Atlantic's Bracket City game. Input your clues and corresponding answers, and it generates a playable game your friends can try to solve.

No setup, no servers, just a self-contained file that runs directly in your browser.

**How to Use:**

1. Download the Project: Click the green "Code" button at the top of the repository and select "Download ZIP"

2. Unzip the file once downloaded

3. Double-click on the file called "index.html" to open it in your browser (this works locally, no internet connection required)

4. Enter the full puzzle with all of your brackets

5. Enter the answers for each of your bracketed clues

6. Challenge a friend to play your game, or play it yourself!
